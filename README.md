This is an asynchronous communication hub software on Linux that connects RFCOMM(Bluetooth), TCP/IP, RS232 devices together in the project.

The core IO library of this work is a clone of libuv, which is the IO implementation Node.js. The library is written with the reference to libuv source code.

Built by CMake, depends on BlueZ library for Bluetooth communication.
